        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <h3>"this" Keyword</h3>
          <p>The "this" keyword refers to the current object</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
let dog = {
  name = "Timmy",
  printName() {
    // "this" refers to this object
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>"this" can be used in any function. Not just in methods. The value of this is decided at run time. "this"
            is free in Javascript where in other languages it is bound. This can lets us use the same function for
            different objects, but it can make it easier to make mistakes.</p>
          <p>Arrow functions have no "this"</p>
          <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
          <p>The DOM represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes. The HTML element is the root node.
          </p>
          <p>We can use any language to access and manipulate the DOM, but JavaScript is definitely the most popular.
          </p>
          <p>Node lists aren't arrays, but you can loop through them and access elements through index notation. You can
            also convert them to an array.</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
// convert a node list to an array
const imageArray = Array.from(document.images);

// using the spread operator
const imageArray = [...document.images];
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Be careful of empty text nodes when selecting child nodes.</p>
          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>Event listners listen for an event and the call a callback function whenever that event happens.</p>
          <p>When the callback function is called, an event object is passed in which contains information about the
            event.</p>
          <p>Event propagation is the order that the events fire on each element. Clicking on an element clicks on all
            the elements it's nested inside of. The event either bubbles, it starts on the element that was clicked on
            and propogates until it reaches the root node, or it captures, it starts at the root and propogates until it
            reaches the element that was clicked on.</p>
          <p>If you have two events, one on a parent and another on a child, bubbling would fire the one on the child
            first and then the one on the parent. Capturing would fire the parents first. Propogation can also be
            stopped by using event.stopPropagation()</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
liElement.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
console.log('clicked on li');
// stop the event from propogating
event.stopPropagation(); }, false);
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Is there any reason to use selectors like getElementById instead of querySelector?</li>
          <li>What are some examples of when bubbling would be better than capturing and vice versa?</li>
        </ul>
